-- SQL script to create storage buckets in Supabase
-- Note: This must be run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Storage buckets are created via the Supabase Dashboard, but you can use this as reference

-- IMPORTANT: Buckets must be created manually in Supabase Dashboard:
-- 1. Go to Storage in Supabase Dashboard
-- 2. Click "New bucket"
-- 3. Create buckets: 'media', 'logos', 'favicons'
-- 4. Set them as PUBLIC
-- 5. Configure RLS policies (see below)

-- RLS Policies for Storage Buckets
-- Run these after creating the buckets
